# Project 1: Processing health and activity data [40 marks]

---

Make sure you read the instructions in `README.md` before starting! In particular, make sure your code is well-commented, with sensible structure, and easy to read throughout your notebook.

The MMASH dataset [1, 2] is is a dataset of health- and activity-related measurements taken on 22 different people, over a continuous period of 24 hours, using wearable devices.

In this project, we have provided you with some of this data for **10** of those individuals. In the `dataset` folder, you will find:

- a file `subject_info.txt` which summarises the age (in years), height (in cm), and weight (in kg) of all 10 study participants,
- 10 folders named `subject_X`, which each contain two files:
    - `heartbeats.txt` contains data on all individual heartbeats detected over the 24-hour study period,
    - `actigraph.txt` contains heart rate and other activity data measured with another device, over the same 24-hour period.

The tasks below will guide you through using your Python skills to process some of this data. Note that the data was reformatted slightly for the purpose of the assignment (to make your life a bit easier!), but the values are all the original ones from the real dataset.

### Getting stuck

Tasks 3 to 8 follow directly from each other. There is a `testing` folder provided for you with `.npy` files and a supplementary `actigraph.txt` dataset. The `.npy` files are NumPy arrays, which you can load directly using `np.load()`, containing an example of what the data should look like after each task. You will be able to use this example data to keep working on the later tasks, even if you get stuck on an earlier task. Look out for the ðŸ’¾ instructions under each task.

These were produced using the data for another person which is not part of the 10 you have in your dataset.
